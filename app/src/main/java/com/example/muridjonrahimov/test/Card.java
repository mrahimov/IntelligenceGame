//       Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card from a deck of cards.
//        Playing cards have two distinguishing properties: rank and suit.
//        A deck consists of 4 suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades
//        And a suit has 13 "ranks": Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King
//        Your class constructor should take SUIT and RANK as parameters.

//
public class Card {
//
//    private String[] suits = {"Spades", "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs"};
//    private String[] ranks = {"Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"};
//
//    public Card(String[] suits, String[] ranks) {
//
//        this.suits = suits;
//        this.ranks = ranks;
//
//    }
