//        The class Movie is started below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class
//        has the following three class variables:
//        title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
//        studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
//        rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
//        a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie,
//        a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the
//        respective class variables to these values.
//        b) Write a second constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the
//        movie and a String representing the studio as its arguments, and sets the respective class variables to
//        these values, while the class variable rating is set to "PG".
//        c) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”,
//        the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”.
